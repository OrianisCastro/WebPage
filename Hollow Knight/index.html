            <h1>A mysterious world</h1>
            <br>
            <p>From the moment we start taking our first steps through Hallownest we realize that we are entering a gigantic world of tunnels and subway palaces. Yet the game has very little dialogue and very few moments in which we can discover the lore of this territory. So how do we know the story of Hallownest? We live it. Team Cherry made a very smart decision to show us the world the way they did. Here we can see devastated cities and palaces and from the few interactions we have with the NPCS we can start to discover some things.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As a good Metroidvania we have a mix of platforming, combat, exploration and final bosses. Hollow Knight is not the most original game in the world, but it knows how to gather all the interesting things from its referents and give it a formal packaging of exceptional quality. Perhaps the most unique feature is its healing system, a risk-reward mechanic in which we have to concentrate for a few seconds to recover a point of life, but that leaves us sold for a couple of endless seconds and that we must recharge (at least initially) by hitting the opponents.</p>

            <h1>Hallownest</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hallownest was once a gigantic subway city. A city that lacked nothing, it had its gardens, its palaces, its mines with precious minerals, its laboratories for its scientists and the different inhabitants of the kingdom could live in peace. I say all this because at the time we play, Hallownest was transformed into a dead shell of this great city. As we explore and get to know the world we can begin to discover what was its past and what is the history of the different characters with whom we will cross.

        <h1>Game Design</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The level design is exceptional: rich, complex, interconnected, full of secrets that reward the curious... It does not lower the level at any time, but the overall structure of the game sometimes suffers from the freedom that we are given to face much of the adventure. As at the beginning we are not offered any minimally clear objective, it is easy to find certain slowdowns when we need a skill that is at the other end of the map without us having a record of this detail.
        </p>
        <p>Its greatest success is, in any case, its visual design work. Each area has a very prominent personality that goes from the type of platforming proposed to a slight chromatic variation that is visible despite the desaturated color palette. 
        </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>We live in a world where new video game projects are coming out every day. The indie development scene has exploded and many analysts talk about a supposed "indiepocalypse". Hollow Knight picks up the baton from a multitude of high quality Metroidvanias: the level design work is accompanied by great animations, a world in which you want to dive again and again, charismatic characters and an intriguing storyline. Although some loose ideas don't land as well as the rest, but when the whole maintains a level of excellence so often it's easy to forgive a couple of missteps.</p>
