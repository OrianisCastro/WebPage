            <h1>Celeste: climbing the mountain of depression</h1>
            <br>
            <p>There are video games that go beyond the barrier of the video game itself to become something more. Video games that are covered with multiple layers, all of them with different nuances that leave a very special aftertaste through a very human language.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Celeste', as we have been saying since last week, is more than just an exquisite platformer. It is a video game before which it is easy to run out of adjectives that define all its greatness, how wonderfully cared for it is, and how delicious it is at a playable level thanks to a level design so meticulously cared for that will catch us and surprise us as rarely before.</p>

            <h1>Madeline's personal challenge</h1>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>Madeline needs to disconnect. She arrives at the starting point of the mountain nervous, trying to calm herself down. We don't know what exactly she's there for, but what seems like the personal challenge of anyone who has ever climbed a mountain, here takes on a much more transcendental aspect as she delves deeper into her life.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>She had already been warned, in a way (not without a hint of derision), by an old woman guarding the entrance. In the mountains you see things, things you are not prepared for. A fact that poor Madeline will soon discover, seeing how the mountain is taking an increasingly dangerous shape.</strong>

        <h1>Celeste hides many secrets inside</h1>
        <br>
        <p>'Celeste' is a faithful reflection of what terrifies us, of those fears or insecurities that make us feel uncomfortable and affect our mental health. It is a journey of self-improvement that will never cease to surprise us thanks to the role played by the mountain itself, and that serves as a perfect complement to Madeline's, a priori, scarce skills as a mountaineer: jumping, climbing and sprinting.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is incredible what 'Celeste' achieves with so few resources, with such a simple control and full of so many possibilities. And much of the blame lies in its own environment: the mountain.
        Because each chapter, each section of the mountain, is a world in itself where the elements that surround us are shaping the capabilities of Madeline.
        </p>
      
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Celeste can be intimidating because of its great difficulty at the beginning, but it never frightens the player because of the constant deaths in many screens.
        The game encourages us to continue and persevere, to not give up the effort to climb the mountain, a not very subtle metaphor for the depression suffered by the protagonist, even without oxygen or sherpa. 
        We always have the feeling that each death is not a failure, but a small step in the right direction, as welearn and improve. That is the greatest merit of the game: combining an intricate level design full of original ideas with a precise control and always pushing us to continue, without getting frustrated or despairing.</p>
