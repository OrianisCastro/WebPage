            <h1>GRIS, the metaphorical tonality</h1>
            <br>
            <p>It is not by chance that GRIS is called precisely gray, in allusion to the color. Also because the protagonist has the same name, representing the state of mind in which she is immersed. Because this adventure is a manifestation of the pain she suffers and how she copes with it, not without effort.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inspired by the work <strong>Gris by Guim Ti√≥</strong> , we are facing a story of overcoming where we will leave behind, little by little, that feeling of transitory incapacity of the young woman to the point of showing two totally opposite sides: that of a walk under an incomparable frame and that of a platform that gains in nuances as we unlock its four colors.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the early stages it's practically a contemplation adventure where we will just walk and make the occasional jump. If we pause and look at the controls, in fact, it will only be explained to us that there is only one action button: the jump button. But this is simply because we see everything gray.</p>

            <h1>A journey where only the journey matters</h1>
            <br>
            <p>We will wander through its evocative world without apparent direction, but in reality everything is studied to the millimeter, with the same precision as the geometric figures and perfect symmetries of the marvelous universe.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are facing a carefree space, where you can enjoy the scenery (at every step you make a capture, the level of detail is tremendous) and where it will be difficult to get frustrated with their puzzles. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We would love to talk about the abilities of GRIS, but we prefer you to discover them on your own. What we will say is that each color brings unique tonalities to this experience, with very imaginative situations (and others that we have already seen in other productions, although also in a very special way) and where the camera will always have an essential role, playing a lot with zoom and photography.</p>

        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <br>
        <p>We would love to talk about the abilities of GRIS, but we prefer you to discover them on your own. What we will say is that each color brings unique tonalities to this experience, with very imaginative situations (and others that we have already seen in other productions, although also in a very special way) and where the camera will always have an essential role, playing a lot with zoom and photography. </p>
        <br>
        <p>There is a certain replayable component, in addition, for all those collectibles that we mentioned at the beginning. At the end of the story we can load the game from different points to try to achieve that 100% that slightly lengthen the life of this artistic manifestation made videogame and where the soundtrack of Berlinist fits perfectly to know how to interpret the rhythm of each situation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In short, GRIS is not just a pretty face: it is a work that serves to vindicate the enormous Spanish talent that we have been experiencing for some time. A platformer that conquers us little by little, as we unlock its colors. A song full of hope, literally.</p>
